# Project Mesto-React with authentication

---

The social network for communication with pictures and likes.

Implemented user registration and authorization. 

It's possible to change profile name and description, add, delete and like photos, as well as open large-size photos. Form validation has been added.

Changes to user information and his avatar are made by changing data on the server. The cards are loaded from the server from the group's common database. Any user can give or take away a like to any card. Only your own cards can be deleted.
